# Random-Access-Simulator
1. The program is based on MATLAB.
2. In LTE cellular network, machines use random channels to access network, thus there might be some collisions if they choose    the same channel.
3. This system simulates the random access process in a network with thousands of devices.
4. The system calculates the performance of the network like the collission rate, average delay, energy consumption, etc.
5. The results is calibrated with 3GPP, which gives it credit to be used by following researchers.
